// Step 1: Generate Image
// Step 2: Run the vector of Star objects through our copy-and-pasted undistortion algo
// Step 3: Use opencv's undistort and to undistort generated image and compare with ours.
//        We can compare either by comparing each pixel side by side or just eyeballing each undistorted image printed
//        out with an opencv func.
